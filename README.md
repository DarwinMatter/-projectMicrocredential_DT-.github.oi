For this project, we use the data set from "Distribution, climatic relationships, and status of American pikas (Ochotona princeps) in the Great Basin, USA" [1], cited below. Specifically, we use data coming from Appendix 3: Master Database -- Extant Great Basin Pika Sites, Published and Unpublished Sources.

The goals of this project can be found in "Hypothesis.pdf" file. We perform our computations in R, the code is contained in "Project.Rmd". We write our code in R Markdown, so the code generates a htlm file for better visualization of the content.
